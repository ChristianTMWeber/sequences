## Sequences

A small project investigating the nature of a bunch fixed length strings that originate from 'k' probabilistic processes. The goal is to find k, identify the groups of strings that belong to each process, and ideally identify the nature of the probabilistic processes.

The main work of investigating the strings nature happens in the 'Solution' jupyter notebook. The 'functions' folder holds some auxiliary functions.

### Environment Setup
We can use conda to setup the environment:

	conda env create -f environment.yml

Once setup, the relevant environment can be activated via

	conda activate sequences_env

When done, deactivate the environment via

	conda deactivate
